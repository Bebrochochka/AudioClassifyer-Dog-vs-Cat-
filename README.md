# AudioClassifier ðŸŽµ

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is **AudioClassifier**, a machine learning project I built to classify short audio samples into different categories like **dog, cat, cow**, and more.  

I actually created **two versions**:  
1. A simple **binary classifier** that distinguishes between dog and cat sounds.  
2. A **multiclass classifier** that can tell apart dog, cat, and cow audio samples.

## ðŸ§  How it works

The core of the project is a **custom CNN** that works on **Mel-spectrograms** of audio samples.  
It learns the patterns in audio frequencies to predict which animal sound it is.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- The dataset is quite small, about **50â€“90 samples per class**.  
- I used **Kaggle datasets** as a source.  
- Two versions of the dataset: one for binary classification, one for multiclass.

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance

- **Binary classifier (dog vs cat):** ~95% accuracy âœ…  
- **Multiclass classifier (dog, cat, cow):** ~87% accuracy âœ…  

These results were achieved with the custom CNN trained on the spectrograms.

## ðŸš€ Running the project

I built everything to run easily in **Google Colab**:

1. Clone the repo and open the notebook in Colab.  
2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
!pip install -r requirements.txt
